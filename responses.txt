4: Also in the repository place a text file called responses.txt containing answers to the following questions:

* When might you use sed, awk and cut together?
* What is your favourite text editor and why?
* What steps would you take to configure a server to use Apache and Tomcat?
* Users begin complaining about "slowness" on your web application. What steps would you take to investigate this?

Answers: responses.txt

1. Based the scenario will use sed, awk and cut commands. We can use these commands together using "|" symbol

	cut : this command mostly will use when we know the exact delimiter 
	sed : this command mostly will use to do search and replace the patterns in files without opening and same can be done using awk also
	awk : this is a powerful command having syntax like C. which will be used to processing the files which has data arranged in rows and columns format.
	
2. vi is my favourite text editor and below are the reasons why am using it

1.	more simpler to use
2.	we can find this in all the Unix systems by default
3.	it has two modes (command and insert)
4.	it’s a simple program that does not require more system memory and CPU usage.
		
3. What steps would you take to configure a server to use Apache and Tomcat?
		Assuming we want to configure java based application server using Apache and tomcat in linux
		
		1. Install Apache and update the server domain name in apache conf files
		2. Install jdk/jre to be used by tomcat server
		3. Install Tomcat Server and configure the ports in which it has to run
		4. Deploy java based application in Tomcat webapps directory
		5. Add proxy & reverse proxy pass in Apache conf file for java application deployed in tomcat
		
				ProxyPass / http://10.20.100.101:8080/java_application/
				ProxyPassReverse / http://10.20.100.101:8080/java_application/

		
4. * Users begin complaining about "slowness" on your web application. What steps would you take to investigate this?

	First we need to isolate whether the problem is at web application or on the network
		If the slowness is reported by all the users then it could be issue with application side.
		If the slowness is reported by only some set of users and for other if it’s working fine then it could users network issue.
	
	We have to check below things at web application end to find out the slowness 
	We will check the web application logs for any Errors
	We will check is there any issue with Database connectivity if web application is using Database services
	We will check is there any issue with middleware applications if web application is using any middleware applications
	We will check is there any issue with Linux server where the web application is hosted (Memory, Disk Space, I/O and CPU stats)
	We can use developer tools in the browsers (like chrome/firefox etc.) and check which call is taking more time (can also check at file level).
	We can use few monitoring tools like AppDynamics where we have an integrated view of all the systems that are in the application and can spot the slowness.
